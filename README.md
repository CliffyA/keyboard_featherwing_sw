# Keyboard FeatherWing CircuitPython Code

This repository aims to collect example code for the Keyboard FeatherWing.

The `code.py` file is the factory test used to verify all the HW on the FeatherWing. It's very basic right now.

Only the custom library is provided here, all the other libraries must be acquired from Adafruit's repositories:
